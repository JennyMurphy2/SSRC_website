<!--more-->

Sports researchers often define research hypothesis using vague or "umbrella" terms, such as "strength" or "performance" instead of using specific, testable dependent variables (DVs). Having a hypothesis tested using several variables greater than 1 is problematic, because hypothesis testing by its nature is determined using binominal outcomes - either the hypothesis is consistent with the data, or it is not. How do researchers select variables to conclude with in the case where DVs > 1? In addition, having a number of tested dependent variables also reduces the likelihood that a study is sufficiently powered to detect true effects for all measured factors, given that power analysis (if any) is typically calculated using a single effect of interest. This masters project will investigate the potential issues of this practice, and report on the ratio of tested variables to hypothesis statements, in a random sub-set of Sports Science published research papers.
