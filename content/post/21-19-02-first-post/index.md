Welcome everyone to this new website for the Sports Science Replication Centre.

<!--more-->

By creating this website, we hope that you will be able to discover the faces behind this exciting project and spead the awareness of the project as we move through different stages.

For the moment, we are establishing a selection protocol for studies for replication and you should keep an eye out for the preprint version of that which will be coming available soon. In 2021, we will also be starting a big recruitment drive for labs to collaborate with us. If that is something you think you might be interested in, or would like to learn more about, please see the collaborate section or use the contact form to get in touch with us.

We will be updating this website with future publications and talks but if there is anything you specifically want to know more about please contact us! We welcome all feedback and conversation regarding the goals of the centre.

Thanks for reading!
