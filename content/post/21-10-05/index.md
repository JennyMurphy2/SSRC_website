We are recruiting any applied sports and exercise researchers, and their undergraduate or postgraduate students, to help us. The success of this ambitious projects relies on volunteers to provide an estimate of the replicability of the sports and exercise science field.

Studies to be replicated will be selected according to our protocol which is available to view [**here**](https://osf.io/v3wz4/) as a preprint on OSF. 

If you are interested in collaborating with us, please fill out the [**Expression of Interest**](https://forms.office.com/r/iL0z0AFhVC) form and we will contact you. If you need more information, check out our "collaborate" section of this website or contact us via the contact page.
