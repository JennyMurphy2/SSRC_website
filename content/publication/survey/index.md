abstract: There are formal calls for increased reproducibility and replicability in sports and exercise science, yet there is minimal information on the overall knowledge of these concepts at a field-wide level. Therefore, we conducted a survey on the attitudes and perceptions of sports and exercise science researchers towards reproducibility and replicability. Descriptive statistics (e.g., proportion of responses), and thematic analysis, were utilized to characterize the responses. Of the 511 respondents, 42% (n = 217) believe there is a significant crisis of reproducibility or replicability in sports and exercise science while 36% (n = 182) believe there is a slight crisis. 3% (n = 15) of respondents believe there is no crisis while 19% (n = 95) did not know. Four themes were generated in the thematic analysis - the research and publishing culture, educational barriers to research integrity, research responsibility to ensure reproducibility and replicability, and current practices facilitating reproducibility and replicability. Researchers believe that engaging in open science can be detrimental to career opportunities due to lack of incentives. They also feel journals are a barrier to reproducible and replicable research due to high publication charges and a focus on novelty. Statistical expertise was identified as a key factor for improving reproducibility and replicability in the future, particularly, a better understanding of study design and different statistical techniques. Statistical education should be prioritised for early career researchers which could positively affect publication and peer review. Researchers must accept responsibility for reproducibility and replicability with thorough project design, appropriate planning of analyses, and transparent reporting practices.
