Barry Gorman is completing a MPhil at Technological University Dublin which began in January 2024. His MPhil is concerned with questionable research practices in sports and exercise science research, specifically the testing of multiple variables for a single hypothesis. Barry hopes this critical exploration will lead to more robust and transparent practices within this research field. Barry is also keenly interested in injury mechanism and injury rehabilitation research.
